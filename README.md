## Project Summary

This was the most challenging app I have learned to build so far. I learned how to draw on HTML canvas with Javascript. I learned how to make shapes move on HTML canvas. I learned how to test for collisions and impliment conditions based on those collisions. Lastly, I learned how to use setInterval() in order to make objects move smoothly on the screen.
